# UW Data Science Incubator Wrap-up

We finished up the Incubator with a series of talks on all of the projects this afternoon. Although I've been working with everyone for the last 3 months, it was really great to see how much progress we have all made on our projects! You can see my slides from the final presentation [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7e1fkazwpkj29ue/Clayton_incubator_final.pdf?dl=0). Of course, the project isn't really over! There's so much more data analysis to do, but thanks to all the help I've had from Dan with Myria and SQL, I'm now ready to attack most of it solo.
