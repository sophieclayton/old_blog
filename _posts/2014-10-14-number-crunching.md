## Number crunching with SQLshare

I'm quickly becoming a firm believer in the power of databases for data analysis. Coming from a research background strongly biased towards numerical modelling, I've done a fair amount of coding in matlab, python and fortran, but I'd never really had any reason to use sql. 

My big job for the week is to put data from different oceanographic instruments, from different cruises on different ships into the same format. There really are an awful lot of different ways to present the same information, but when, like me, you are trying to do a meta-analysis, it reallt helps to make everything consistent.
