## Number crunching with SQLshare

I'm quickly becoming a firm believer in the power of databases for data analysis. Coming from a research background strongly biased towards numerical modelling, I've done a fair amount of coding in matlab, python and fortran, but I'd never really had any reason to use sql. 

My big job for the week is to put data from different oceanographic instruments, from different cruises, on different ships into the same format. There really are an awful lot of different ways to present the same information, but when, like me, you are trying to do a meta-analysis, it really helps to make everything consistent. This is really quite mundane work in the grand scheme of things, but getting this done will mean that I can finally get stuck into the fun part of the analysis. 

I uploaded all of my data to the SQLshare database, and have been running queries through the online interface. Today has been a big success, I've processed 5 of the 8 cruises that still have underway data missing in the Myria database.
