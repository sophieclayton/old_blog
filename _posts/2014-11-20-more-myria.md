# Rescaling data and revisiting diversity indices

I was able to put several things together today. 
Having rescaled all of the cytometric data earlier in the week, I worked with Dan to add to the diversity query to incorporate the Shannon index and evenness.
Thankfully the cluster wasn't too tied up with other jobs today, so I was able to run the new and improved diversity query and start exploring the results.
I also joined the results of the diversity query with the environmental data, and started exploring relationships between diversity and different factors. 
I'm continuing to use iPython notebooks for data analysis and visualisation, and sharing results with colleagues.
I may never use Matlab again!
