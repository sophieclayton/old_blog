## What do biological oceanography and database queries have in common?

This is something that I've been thinking about and working on since December last year... And not something that I ever imagined that I'd care about. But there we go, that's science for you.

As part of the UW's eScience Incubator program, I'm working with Dan Halperin and Bill Howe to analyse a large dataset of underway flow cytometry data using the UW's Myria database.
