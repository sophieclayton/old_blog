## Software Carpentry Instructor Training

I just spent the last three days taking part in a [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) instructor training workshop at the UW. Software Carpentry's mission is to teach researchers basic scientific computing skills to help them become more efficient in their work. I had attended a Software Carpentry bootcamp in Boston back in 2013, and I wished that I had had the opportunity to do it sooner... like when I first started grad school! I hate to think of the amount of time I wasted during my PhD, just because I didn't have the computing background to know how to do things more efficiently. Although I didn't implement a lot of changes to the way I work all in one go, I have gradually incorporated git version control and shifting from matlab to python in the year and a half since I took part in the training. 

About 20 people took part in the UW/Software Carpentry workshop. It's exciting to think that we will now have a large cohort of local instructors, allowing us to offer workshops on a regular basis at the UW.
