## Shifting my focus to data analysis

Six weeks' into the eScience incubator project, and I'm starting to shift my focus to data analysis and figure generation, rather than working on the technical infrastructure necessary to work with the data. I spent today writing python scripts to extract and visualise data from Myria. I'm keeping track of it all with iPython notebooks saved in my [eScience github repository](https://github.com/uwescience/seaflow-myria/tree/master/ipython_notebooks).
