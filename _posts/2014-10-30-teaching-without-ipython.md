title: Undergrad numerical modelling practical

## Numerical modelling practical for undergrads, minus IPython

I taught a numerical modelling practical for upper level undergrads today. I had hoped to use IPython notebooks to immerse them in the code used to run simple numerical models, but it didn't work out... The computer lab wasn't set up for IPython and there wasn't time to fix that before the class. I ended up completely re-writing the class materials in Matlab to be sure that it would run smoothly. And it did! I tried to structure the class so that the students would have to interact with me and each other to think about how numerical models are built, parameterised, forced, and the output analysed. All of my teaching materials can be found in my [github teaching repository](http://github.com/sophieclayton/teaching/tree/master/OCN430_modelling). I'm sure that I could improve the class for next time, but the feedback from students and the course leader was all good, so I'll call it a success!
