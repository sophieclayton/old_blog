title: IPython notebooks for teaching

## IPython notebooks as a teaching tool... hopefully!

I'm teaching a numerical modelling practical for the UW's OCN430 class this Thursday. My plan is to base the class on Gordon Riley's uber-cool 1946 paper which develops a statistical and mechanistic model for phytoplankton dynamics on the George's Bank. It's a classic that anyone interested in phytoplankton ecology/biological modelling needs to read. Here' the reference, go read it!

Riley, G. A. (1946) Factors Controlling Phytoplankton Populations on George's Bank. *J. Mar. Res.* **6**, pp 54-73

I'm guessing that the vast majority of the students will have little to no experience with any kind of programming language, so I'm trying to find a way to expose them to code as painlessly as possible. So... it occurred to me that an IPython notebook might be just the ticket! I've coded up a version of Riley's model in python, and will get the students to do some sensitivity analyses for some of the parameters and update plots with the new output. Expect an update on how it went later this week.
