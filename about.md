I'm an oceanographer working in the Biological Oceanography department of the University of Washington's School of Oceanography. My research is mostly concerned with observing and understanding patterns in phytoplankton community structure and biodiversity in the oceans. Although I work with data and models spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales, my real interest lies at the meso- and submesoscales, where the characteristic time and space scales of phytoplankton and ocean physics coincide. I have a background in physical oceanography (Physical Oceanography PhD, MIT/WHOI Joint Program) along with extensive experience collecting biological and physical data at sea, and collaborating with phytoplankton ecologists.
