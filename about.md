I'm an oceanographer currently working in the [Armbrust Lab](http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/), part of the [University of Washington's School of Oceanography](http://www.ocean.washington.edu/). My research is mostly concerned with observing and understanding patterns in phytoplankton community structure and biodiversity in the oceans. Although I work with data and models spanning a range of spatial and temporal scales, my real interest lies at the meso- and submesoscales, where the characteristic time and space scales of phytoplankton and ocean physics coincide. I have a background in physical oceanography (Physical Oceanography PhD, MIT/WHOI Joint Program) along with extensive experience collecting biological and physical data at sea, and collaborating with phytoplankton ecologists. Recently I have also been working with data scientists in the [UW's eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/) to develop ways to work effectively with oceanographic "big data".
